//every integer data type have range to make store in RAM
//Base-2 format => n-bits => min(-2^n-1) to max(2^n-1 - 1)
//either it is Integer Overflow 

//byte => 1 byte=> 8 bits => -128 to 127
// byte a  = 128;
// System.out.println(a);
//it give error because it is out of range for byte data type


//short => 2bytes stored=> 16bits=>-32768 to 32767=> total value=> 65536

//int=> 4 bytes=> 32 bits=> -2147483648 to 2147483647

//long=> 8bytes=> 64 bits=> -2^63 to 2^63-1

//there 4 different data types associated with integer => bcause there are various intger range values in integer

//How they convert the data into binary form

//using the base-2 format 

//we can store it the value in binary form


// in Java if u give input in integer form of data e.g (binary,hexa,octal,) the output u get in form of Decimal, it first converted in the form of binary and then it ecimal obtained and u get output in decimal form

//for e.g =>> int a = 045;(octal)

//s.o.p(a) =>> 37; 
//if any prefix added to integer type it must converted into binary and then for output in decimal
//e.g=>> int a = 0x45,yy45
